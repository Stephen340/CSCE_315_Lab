        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a student at A&M majoring in computer science with an interest in artificial intelligence and neural
            networks.
            I enjoy working with technology, and I welcome new ideas and opportunities to increase my experience and
            knowledge within the sector of
            computer science. I currently have experience with multiple different coding languages and software
            systems.
            I have worked as a leader for several organizations and club activities, developing team management skills
            as
            well as project management skills. I am looking for an internship opportunity for the summer of 2023, and
            welcome any and all
            opportunities to do so.

        <h1>Relevant Information</h1>
        <p>During my next semester at A&M, I will be taking classes focusing on artificial intelligence and software
            engineering. I am working to be
            a part of the University's Fast Track Program, so that I may take graduate classes as an undergraduate.
            These
            classes include Artificial Intelligence,
            Theory of Computability, and Analysis of Algorithms. I also plan on becoming involved in research
            involving
            artifical intelligence during my time
            attending Texas A&M.

        <!-- Service Section -->
        <div class="service" role="article">
        <h1>Service Activities</h1>
        <p>I have been active in my local service community for many years, which started when I became a part of my
            Junior Honors Society in middle school.
            I have worked with local schools to set up concerts, fairs, and even fundraising activities such as
            bazaars
            including hundreds of people and vendors.
            I have also participated in local food banks as a volunteer, working in a variety of roles, including
            customer
            service. I have worked as a technician in
            local school-led drumline activities meant to introduce younger students to marching band activities and
            music
            performance. I taught students music and
            technical skills on instruments, and aided in putting together a final performance for these students.
