        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p1>I am a student at A&M majoring in computer science with an interest in artificial intelligence and neural networks. 
            I enjoy working with technology, and I welcome new ideas and opportunities to increase my experience and knowledge within the sector of 
            computer science. I currently have experience with multiple different coding languages and software systems. 
            I have worked as a leader for several organizations and club activities, developing team management skills as 
            well as project management skills. I am looking for an internship opportunity for the summer of 2023, and welcome any and all 
            opportunities to do as such.

        <h2>Relevant Information</h2>
        <p1>During my next semester at A&M, I will be taking classes focusing on artificial intelligence and software engineering. I am working to be
            a part of the University's Fast Track Program, so that I may take graduate classes as an undergraduate. These classes include Artificial Intelligence,
            Theory of Computability, and Analysis of Algorithms. I also plan on becoming involved in research involving artifical intelligence during my time
            attending Texas A&M.

        <h3>Service Activities</h3>
        <p1>I have been active in my local service community for many years, which started when I became a part of my Junior Honors Society in middle school.
            I have worked with local schools to set up concerts, fairs, and even fundraising activities such as bazaars including hundreds of people and vedors.
            I have also participated in local food banks as a volunteer, working in a variety of roles, including customer service. I have worked as a technician in
            local school-led drumline activities meant to introduce younger students to marching band activities and music performance. I taught students music and
            technical skills on instruments, and aided in putting together a final performance for these students.
