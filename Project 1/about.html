    <h1>Technical Projects</h1>
    <li>Piano Application:</li>
    <p>As a part of HowdyHack 2021, I built an application meant to help beginner musicians learn chords and music
    notes more efficiently. The application can play both individual piano notes as well as chords. The piano has a
    toggle button, which allows the application to play both major and minor chords for the user. The application
    was built entirely in Python, using the Python Imaging Library, playsound, and tkinter imports to allow for the
    creation of buttons on the piano and the ability to play sound files attached to the specific buttons.</p>

    <li>Competitive Robot</li>
    <p>I participated in an independent, non-affiliated robotics group as a part of the FIRST Tech Challenge, and acted
    as a programmer for the robot. Programs were written in Java and included controlling the robot's movement and
    speed, controlling a separate crane attached to the robot meant to pick up objects, and controlling an rgb color
    sensor to detect specific objects for the robot to interact with. The robot had both an automatic movement system
    to fulfill tasks individually, and a controlled movement system from a driver.</p>

    <li>Assembler and Disassembler</li>
    <p>This project contains both an assembler and a disassembler for the hack assembly language. The assembler takes
    hack assembly language instructions and converts them into binary instructions that can be followed by a machine.
    The disassembler takes binary instructions and converts them into hack assembly instructions. The assembler and
    disassembler were both built in Python, but upon feeding in a file of the proper language, will convert the .hack
    file into a .asm file or vice versa.</p>

    <li>Method of Least Squares Regression Analysis</li>
    <p>This project takes in a file containing several lists of information about a graph containing individual points,
    and performs a regression analysis to determine a solution represented by one or more lines of best fit. The
    program minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals, and given a fixed cost for individual lines of best fit
    and the length of these lines, will determine the lowest cost possible for the given system.</p>
