    <h1>Technical Projects</h1>
    <li>Piano Application:</li>
    <p>As a part of HowdyHack 2021, I built an application meant to help beginner musicians learn chords and music
    notes more efficiently. The application can play both individual piano notes as well as chords. The piano has a
    toggle button, which allows the application to play both major and minor chords for the user. The application
    was built entirely in Python, using the Python Imaging Library, playsound, and tkinter imports to allow for the
    creation of buttons on the piano and the ability to play sound files attached to the specific buttons.</p>

    <li>Competitive Robot</li>
    <p>I participated in an independent, non-affiliated robotics group as a part of the FIRST Tech Challenge, and acted
    as a programmer for the robot. Programs were written in Java and included controlling the robot's movement and
    speed, controlling a separate crane attached to the robot meant to pick up objects, and controlling an rgb color
    sensor to detect specific objects for the robot to interact with. The robot had both an automatic movement system
    to fulfill tasks individually, and a controlled movement system from a driver.</p>

    <li>Assembler and Disassembler</li>
    <p>This project contains both an assembler and a disassembler for the hack assembly language. The assembler takes
    hack assembly language instructions and converts them into binary instructions that can be followed by a machine.
    The disassembler takes binary instructions and converts them into hack assembly instructions. The assembler and
    disassembler were both built in Python, but upon feeding in a file of the proper language, will convert the .hack
    file into a .asm file or vice versa.</p>

    <li>Method of Least Squares Regression Analysis</li>
    <p>This project takes in a file containing several lists of information about a graph's individual points,
    and performs a regression analysis to determine a solution represented by one or more lines of best fit. The
    program minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals, and given a fixed cost for individual lines of best fit
    and the length of these lines, will determine the lowest cost possible for the given system.</p>

        <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
        <p>I am proficient with multiple programming languages, including Java, Python, C++, C, and Haskell. I have been programming in each of these languages
        for at least one year, though I do have more experience programming with some more than others. I have spent over five years programming with java, 
        even using the language for my robotics team as a part of the FIRST Tech Challenge. I have been programming with C++ and Python for three years each.
        I have used C++ mostly for my schoolwork, however, I have programmed some projects in Python, most notable the Harmonia Piano Application referenced in the
        above Technical Projects section. Haskell is a language I am not as familiar with, but have been working towards becoming more proficient due to its uniqueness
        among these languages as being a pure lazy functional programming language.</p>
        <p>
            I had a brief exposure to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a part of a programming summer camp I did years ago, but I just recently began relearning them due to
            their use in classes at Texas A&M. I am most unfamiliar with these languages, but I am putting in effort to quickly become more and more comfortable with them
            each day. 
        </p>
        <h4>Technical Areas of Interest</h4>
        <p>I am most interested in Artificial Intelligence and its broadly encompassed sector, including deep learning, machine learning, neural networks, and more. 
            This interest began back in high school when I joined the Broken Axles Independent Robotics Team, and through my brief experience working with SciKit in
            an attempt to teach the robot how to recognize different colors and objects. While unable to properly do so at the time, and while not entirely artificial intelligence,
            I realized that I had enjoyed the experience and wanted to do more like it. This led me to joining TidalTamu my sophomore year, furthering my exposure to the subject
            and cementing my interest in pursuing it.
            Due to this fascination, I will be focusing on machine learning and artificial intelligence
            in my studies next semester. I also plan to pursue a Master of Science Degree in Computer Science, while focusing my research and classes on artificial intelligence
            as much as possible.
